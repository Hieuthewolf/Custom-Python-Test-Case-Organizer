## Custom Python Test Case Organizer
This is a python snippet that conveniently organizes test cases in a TXT format to a readable and usable Python dictionary
that can be easily parsed and used for unit-testing. 

## Motivation
I wanted to create this snippet to avoid writing repetitous code everytime I wanted to use test cases contained in a TXT format 
with my Python functions. If there were hundreds of test cases, this snippet would save me a lot of time to copy and paste over the test cases from the TXT file to my Python file. 

## Tech/framework used
Ex. - Python

<b>Built with</b>
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
## Usage
- Have your test.txt file inside the same folder as transform_test_case.py
- Change the name of the test case file to the name of your file + ".txt"
- Run:
```
$ python transform_test_case.py
```
