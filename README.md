This is a basic txt file to python snippet that conveniently converts test cases in a txt format to a usable and 
organized Python dictionary that can easily be used for unit-testing.

I wanted to create this snippet to avoid writing repetitous code everytime I wanted to use test cases contained in a txt format 
with my Python functions.

## Usage
- Have your test.txt file inside the same folder as transform_test_case.py
